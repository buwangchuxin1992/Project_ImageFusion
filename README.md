# Project of image fusion
The main purpose of this program is to fuse different images in different ways.
Through fusion processing, the edge information of the original image is increased,
and the focus of defocus image is finally achieved.

Realization of fusion image construction through main.m

Image evaluation by analyzeoffusionimage.m
The procedure is evaluated mainly from four aspects:correlation|entropy|RMSE|PSNR

The fusion algorithm used by the program:
fuse_con|fuse_dwb|fuse_rat|fuse_sih|fuse_fsd|fuse_gra|fuse_lap|fuse_pca|fuse_mod
